PushMaster v1.2.2 - Dynamic Dungeon Name Resolution

MAJOR FIXES:
• Fixed "Dungeon 504" and similar display issues by using WoW API instead of hardcoded mappings
• Replaced hardcoded dungeon name tables with proper C_ChallengeMode.GetMapUIInfo() calls
• Added automatic support for all WoW languages and locales
• Ensured compatibility with any current or future dungeons without code updates

IMPROVEMENTS:
• Dynamic name resolution - dungeon names retrieved directly from Blizzard's API in real-time
• Code cleanup - removed obsolete hardcoded dungeon name mappings
• Better reliability - no more missing dungeon names when new content is added
• API compliance - now uses the same method as other professional addons

TECHNICAL BENEFITS:
• Eliminates need to manually update dungeon mappings for new content
• Reduced code complexity by removing unnecessary mapping tables
• Future-proof design that adapts automatically to game updates

This update ensures PushMaster displays proper dungeon names for all dungeons, including new ones added in future patches, without requiring addon updates.
