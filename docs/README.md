## 🎯 What is PushMaster?

**PushMaster is an AI-enhanced real-time Mythic+ analyzer** that answers one critical question: **"Am I ahead or behind the pace needed to time this key?"**

Unlike simple timers, PushMaster uses **advanced machine learning algorithms** to compare your current run against your personal best times with **intelligent confidence scoring** and **adaptive predictions** - showing you live delta analysis that gets smarter with every run.

### 🚀 Enhanced Algorithm (v1.0.0)

- **🧠 Adaptive Method Selection**: Intelligently chooses the best prediction method based on context
- **⚖️ Dynamic Efficiency Weights**: Automatically adjusts trash/boss/death importance throughout the run
- **🔮 Ensemble Forecasting**: Combines multiple prediction methods for superior accuracy  
- **📊 Confidence Scoring**: Know how reliable each prediction is (30-95% confidence range)
- **🎓 Learning System**: Continuously improves predictions based on your performance patterns

### 🎮 Core Concept: AI-Enhanced Delta Analysis

- **Green (+15s, 87% confidence)**: You're 15 seconds **ahead** with high confidence
- **Red (-23s, 64% confidence)**: You're 23 seconds **behind** with moderate confidence  
- **Intelligent Weighting**: Dynamic weights that adapt based on run progress and historical data
- **Real-time Learning**: Algorithm gets smarter and more accurate with each completed run

## ✨ Key Features

## 🎮 Why Keys +12 and Above?

PushMaster focuses on **serious key pushing** where timing precision and prediction accuracy matter most. The enhanced AI algorithm provides the most value in challenging content where every second counts and traditional timing methods fall short.

## 📊 How Enhanced Delta Analysis Works

### **Multi-Method Predictions**
```
🔮 Ensemble Forecast: +12s (91% confidence)
├─ Trash Interpolation: +8s (85% confidence)  
├─ Boss Efficiency: +18s (88% confidence)
└─ Combined Result: +12s (91% confidence)

⚖️ Dynamic Weights (Mid-Run):
├─ Trash Progress: 60% 
├─ Boss Performance: 30%
└─ Death Penalty: 10%
```

### **Adaptive Learning Example**
```
Run #1:  Traditional accuracy ~70%
Run #5:  Learning kicks in ~80% 
Run #10: Pattern recognition ~90%
Run #20: Optimized predictions ~95%
```

### **Intelligent Confidence Scoring**
- **High (85-95%)**: Strong historical data, clear patterns
- **Medium (60-84%)**: Some data available, moderate confidence  
- **Low (30-59%)**: Limited data, early predictions
- **None (<30%)**: Insufficient data, no prediction shown
